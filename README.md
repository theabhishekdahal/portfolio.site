# Abhishek Dahal's Portfolio Website üëã
Welcome to the source code for my personal portfolio. This project was built from scratch to showcase my journey as an aspiring Chartered Accountant with a strong passion for web development, design, and technology. It's a single-page application built with modern, minimal tools.

### üôè Acknowledgments & Usage

The core **design aesthetics and structural inspiration** for this portfolio were drawn from the beautiful work of [Brittany Chiang](https://brittanychiang.com/).

The **specific implementation, custom features, and detailed design execution**, however, were crafted by me through extensive iterative prompting using **Google AI Studio**. No direct code from the inspired source was used; this project represents an AI-assisted interpretation and build based on the design inspiration.

If you find this repository helpful or choose to adapt this design or code for your own personal portfolio, you are welcome to do so. **All I respectfully ask is that you provide credit for the design inspiration and the AI-assisted implementation.**

A suitable credit in your footer or a "Credits" section might look like this:

`"Design inspired by [Brittany Chiang](https://brittanychiang.com/), implemented by [Abhishek Dahal](https://abhishekdahal.me/) using Google AI Studio."`

Thank you for acknowledging the effort involved!
